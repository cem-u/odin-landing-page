# Landing Page
This repository contains my assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page), where I create a basic landing page using beginner HTML and CSS. Use this [link](https://cem-u.github.io/odin-landing-page/) or the link in the about section to view the website.
